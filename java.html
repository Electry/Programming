				<h1>Java</h1>
				<p>Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the mid 1990s while he was working at Sun Microsystems. One main feature of java that sets it apart from others is that it is <em>machine-independent</em>, meaning that a Java program can be written and run on any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Java is capable of running on any platform because a compiler is used to run it. The compiler takes java code and converts it into a code known as bytecode. The compiler also checks for syntax errors. If there are no errors, the compiler generates a new program based on your java code that is readable by a Java virtual machine (JVM). The JVM is where the Java program actually runs, since it translates the bytecode into machine code. JVM is part of the Java Runtime Environment(JRE). </p>

				<h2>OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)</h2>
				<p>Object-oriented programming is a type of programming that uses the concept of classes and objects. It is a well known approach since we live in a world that is object oriented. Everywhere you look ,ther e are objects, and each object has attributes that make them different from other objects. Classes define how an object will be constructed, then objects are actually created from these classes, which you manipulate in your program. It is a good practice to relate new Java concepts to things in your daily life, as it helps you really understand what is going on.</p>

				<h2>Picking an IDE</h2>
				<p>An Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, is a simple piece of software that aids you in writing code. There are professional IDEs, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ, which are jam packed with features that make creating programs eaiser, and there are other IDEs that are great for introducing new people to programming. I personally reccomend Eclipse, as that is what I am familiar with. Also, <a href="repl.it/languages/java" alt="repl.it">repl.it/languages/java</a> is a useful way to compile and run codes from a computer which you do not have an IDE on.</p>

				<h2>Hello World</h2>
				<p>A hello world program is traditionally the first computer program that a beginning Java programmer writes. <br> ADD HELLO WORLD CODE HERE <br> This example code outputs Hello World. to the console screen.</p>
